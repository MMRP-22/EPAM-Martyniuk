# Get started with Microsoft Teams
## Start here
Whether you're a small business or a multi-national, this is the place to start rolling out Teams. These articles will guide you through a small-scale Teams rollout, which may be all you need if you're a small business or if you're rolling out Teams quickly as your first Microsoft 365 workload to support **remote workers**.
If you're a larger organization, use these articles to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. Later, use the guidance on the <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/#get-started" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Teams Adoption</a> site to help you roll out Teams across your organization.
We recommend rolling out Teams in stages, workload by workload, as your organization is ready. **You don't have to wait until you've completed one step before you move to the next.** Some organizations may want to roll out all Teams features at once, while others may prefer a phased approach. Here are the Teams workloads, in the order we recommend rolling them out:
<li><a href="deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page" data-linktype="relative-path">Chat, teams, channels, &amp; apps</a></li>
<li><a href="deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page" data-linktype="relative-path">Meetings &amp; conferencing</a></li>
<li><a href="cloud-voice-landing-page" data-linktype="relative-path">Cloud voice</a></li>

If you have a medium or large organization, <a href="use-advisor-teams-roll-out" data-linktype="relative-path">use Advisor for Teams to help you roll out Microsoft Teams</a> to help you plan the rollout of these workloads across your organization. The Advisor uses Teams itself to create a plan tasks and assign them to owners, share documents, and enable discussions amongst your deployment team.

## Make sure you're ready
To get ready for your Teams rollout, here's what you need to do, whether Teams is your first workload ("Teams First") or the next workload in an existing Microsoft 365 or Office 365 deployment:
<ul>
<li><p><a href="prepare-network" data-linktype="relative-path">Prepare your organization's network for Teams</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This includes configuring your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 domain, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.</li>
</ul>

## Get familiar with Teams
If you're new to Teams, the best way to get familiar with it is to start using it right away. The great thing about Teams is that what you set up now won't get in the way of any upgrades or migrations you might need to do later.

Use the steps below to set up a couple teams and onboard a few early adopters to help you get familiar with Teams.
